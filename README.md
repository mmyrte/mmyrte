I'm currently (since January 2024) a PhD in [Adrienne
GrÃªt-Regamey](https://irl.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.NTY3OTM=.TGlzdC8xNzM4LC0xMzk1OTgzMDM3.html)'s
group at ETH ZÃ¼rich (<https://plus.ethz.ch/>). I'm looking at the effects of climate
change on land use in the Swiss Alps. Before that, I worked in climate risk analytics for insurance.

If you're curious about any of my sporadic activities on github and want to talk about it a little less formally than an issue discussion, don't hesitate to hit me up! Contact info at my [ETH profile page](https://plus.ethz.ch/chair/people/person-detail.MTg3NjY3.TGlzdC8xMjQyLDE0MzMyMTIxNTg=.html).
